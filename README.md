Selected capstone projects

This is a selection of capstone projects I have been working on.

## EDA_e_commerce data
This is my first project using external data from Kaggle to create an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset.

The original dataset can be found here:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/carrie1/ecommerce-data

Users can get started on this project using an appropriate IDE such as Visual Studio Code or Jupyter notebook and downloading the data from the website above.
Then follow on with the code within this file.

### Why use this?
This code is quite self explanatory with lots of pointers about the data and syntax. The dataset is initially preprocessed, before visualisation is performed.

These include:
- bar plots
- word clouds


## Multiple Regression
This is project uses data from Kaggle to understand what is multiple linear regression.

The original dataset can be found here:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathchi/diabetes-data-set

Users can get started on this project using an appropriate IDE such as Visual Studio Code or Jupyter notebook and downloading the data from the website above.
Then follow on with the code within this file.

### Why use this?
Within this code, you will learn how to:
- Load the dataset
- Pre-process it to look for missing values and how to deal with it
- Perform a little bit of machine learning on the dataset
- Test how good the model performs.

## task_manager
This project is a bit of fun to understand how python works with strings, loops, functions and lots more!

Users can follow this project by downloading the code into an appropriate IDE such as Visual Studio Code.

### Why use this?
Within this code, you can see how:
- Functions are used
- To create small programs that can read and create txt files
- To use defensive programming to ensure the user doesn't see errors
- To handle while and for loops


### Maintenance
All projects are currently maintained by myself. If you need any help, just send me a message.
